OpenStreetMap is a map-based crowd sourcing project whose data has been used by various applications and companies such as Craigslist, MapQuest, Foursquare, and Pictometry. For those of you who attended last month’s GIS/SIG meeting in Rochester or the annual State of the Map, you know first-hand how valuable this project can be for various projects and applications that need access to free mapping.

At our first MapTimeBUF event we will provide an introduction to OpenStreetMap and conduct some hands-on exercises where we will map certain features in the City of Buffalo and/or the surrounding area.

We are looking forward to seeing you there and don’t forget that the Western NY
GIS Users Group is having their Spring meeting right around the corner at the
Main Court Building at 438 Main Street, Buffalo, NY from 4:30 to 6:30.
