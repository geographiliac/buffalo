title: Interactive Map of Buffalo Neighborhood Shootings
published: true

Earlier this month the Buffalo News published an article about shootings in Buffalo neighborhoods. One of the key elements of the story was the data analysis done by Lexie Heinle, Dan Kirchberger and Mary Pasciak including a great interactive map.

The article can be found here <http://bit.ly/2sLtxkS>.

I love seeing these simple, informative maps published. Perhaps the City's forthcoming open data policy will facilitate more of these.

We will be scheduling our next meetup so keep tuned into the MaptimeBUF meetup page!
