I just wanted to thank everyone for attending our meetup event on March 28, 2017. Rick Cielsa entertained us with a great presentation about gathering his personal Google tracking data, converting it to geoJSON, loading it into a MongoDB and rendering it on a a Leaflet map. Thanks again Rick for a great talk!

We are now getting lined up for our next event and hope to have this posted up on Meetup in the coming week. In the meantime please go to our Github site to download the presentation and the one from last May <https://github.com/MaptimeBUF>. I also want to remind everyone about the FOSS4G International Conference in Boston, MA on August 14-19 2017 <http://2017.foss4g.org/>. This is a great event and I encourage anyone who is interested in open source geospatial tools to attend.

See you soon!

Sean
