Hi everyone. My apologies for not communicating well (or at all) over the last several months - it has been hectic for our company.

Thank you as well for responding to the survey. We got some great input from the survey and hope to get people to who can speak to some of the topics of interest.

In order to kickstart the year, Rick Ciesla has offered to talk about his project that involves Managing Google personal location data from a smartphone in MongoDB and displaying it using the Leaflet mapping library.

Rick Ciesla works with database systems by day and is a GIS enthusiast at all times. He is new to the group and anxious to share what he knows about the world of open source web mapping so please join us for an informative and instructive session. 

We will be meeting at the offices of the Partnership for the Public Good at 617 Main Street. Detailed directions can be found on the Meetup page where you RSVP.

Pizza will be provided by NBT Solutions.

Thanks everyone and I am looking forward to seeing all of you again.

Sean
