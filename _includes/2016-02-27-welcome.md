Welcome to the Buffalo chapter of Maptime. We hope this becomes a place where mappers with various experiences can come together and discuss all matters related to mapping.

Over the next several weeks we will be planning our first event which we have tentatively scheduled for sometime in May 2016. If you have any ideas for topics, or want to conduct your own session, let us know! You can follow us and contact us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/maptimeBUF) or our [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Maptime-Buffalo/) page.

Thanks to all of those who have already signed up on the Meetup site. I think this is going to be a very fun and enjoyable experience.
