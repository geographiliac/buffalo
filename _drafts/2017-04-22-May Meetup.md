title: New MaptimeBUF Meetup Scheduled!
author: Sean
---

We have scheduled our next Meetup for May 18th! Haoliang of NBT Solutions will be discussing how to use Leaflet for developing web mapping applications. I had the opportunity to see Haoliang present a similar presentation to the BuffaloJS Meetup group. He does a great job describing how it works and the value of using it for web mapping applications.

You can find the last presentation and code samples on the MaptimeBUF Github <https://github.com/MaptimeBUF>. I also want to remind everyone about the FOSS4G International Conference in Boston, MA on August 14-19 2017 <http://2017.foss4g.org/>. This is a great event and I encourage anyone who is interested in open source geospatial tools to attend.

See you soon!

Sean
